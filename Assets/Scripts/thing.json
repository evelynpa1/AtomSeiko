Press space to drop the element.\n\nInspiration\nOur inspiration comes from Suika Game, a merge dropper game, that combines fruits with the ultimate goal of scoring as many points as possible.\n\nWhat it does\nOur game allows students to play a merge dropper game but in a fun and educational way. As the student combines elements, they learn more about the compounds that can be created and what their reactions do.\n\nHow we built it\nWe built the backend using Google Breadboard, Node.JS, and MongoDB. Google breadboard is used for anything involving talking to chatbots, and for this public release, the MongoDB integration has been removed as the feature is incomplete. However, in the hackathon version of the game, MongoDB was used for storing different element/compound combinations, as well as info about custom games and player progress. For the frontend, we used Unity.\n\nChallenges we ran into\nWE ran into challenges using new, but powerful technologies such as google breadboard. Since it was so new, there were not too many threads about it for interfacing with an API. Also, it was our first time using many of these tech stacks.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe integrated many technologies into one cohesive package. Also, we learned these tech stacks within the span of one day!\n\nWhat we learned\nWe learned that although things may seem hard or downright impossible to implement, with more research these things become very attainable. Also, time budget is a big variable for these kind of development projects.\n\n\nAnswer the question about the game given the description.
